Developed a full-stack budget tracking application designed to help users monitor, analyze, and optimize their personal finances efficiently. The application automates expense tracking by extracting transaction details from bank SMS messages and organizing them into meaningful spending categories such as food, travel, utilities, shopping, and entertainment.

The system provides users with a centralized dashboard to record expenses, set budgets, and track monthly spending trends in real time. Intelligent rule-based categorization and data processing enable accurate expense classification and insightful financial summaries. Interactive visualizations help users clearly understand their spending patterns and identify areas of overspending.

The application emphasizes usability, data accuracy, and security, with features such as authenticated access, persistent data storage, and structured financial analytics. This project demonstrates strong skills in full-stack development, data processing, and applied problem-solving, while addressing real-world challenges in personal finance management—particularly for students and individuals aiming to build better financial discipline.
